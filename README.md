# BriefAI

## Description

**BriefAI** takes a ChatGPT prompt that pulls the latest election news and market data and sends the information as a daily email via the Python email libary. I will be running the script daily on Task Scheduler on my local.

The goal is to generalize this and create a UI where users can customize the types of news/information being sent as well as how it is sent to their mobile device. Increased customizability could potentially be monetized and shipped as a mobile app.
